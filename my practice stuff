# you can add inputs to print with your string

# below is the inproper way to create a sum in python
# it will just place the two inputs next to each other in the printed line
# this is because the input() function is used for strings rather than integers

print("Second Number:")

# here is the right way to do it
# the input just needs to be marked as an integer

print("Second Number:")
second_number = int(input())
sum = first_number + second_number
print(sum)
